Hi there! We're the Computational Limnology team from the Freshwater Ecology section at Aarhus University, Denmark.

To advance aquatic ecosystem modelling, we integrate **model theory** (developing novel models and improving existing code), **model application** (running models on study sites for scenario analysis), and **data science/software development** (developing scientific software, including R package development, for quality assurance and data processing) into our research. Traditionally, our focus is on vertical one-dimensional process-based modeling of aquatic ecosystems by coupling hydrodynamic with water quality models. These coupled models are powerful tools to explore long-term ecosystem dynamics under various stressors such as climate change or eutrophication, and to quantify the causality between abiotic and biotic events across different time scales. 


## Projects


**Here is an overview of our current projects:**

:crystal_ball: **Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning:** developing a modular compositional learning framework to integrate deep learning into a vertical, one-dimensional process-based model for simulating ecosystem dynamics

:earth_americas: **Deductive Metabolism Modeling:** upscaling a spatiotemporal metabolism model to couple gross primary production with carbon sequestration across spatio-temporal scales

:busts_in_silhouette: **LakeEnsemblR-Water Quality:** building a software framework to faciliate setting up, running and post-processing an ensemble of aquatic ecosystem models for structural model-intercomparison
