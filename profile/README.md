Hi there! We're the Computational Limnology team from the Freshwater Ecology section at Aarhus University, Denmark.

To advance aquatic ecosystem modelling, we integrate **model theory** (developing novel models and improving existing code), **model application** (running models on study sites for scenario analysis), and **data science/software development** (developing scientific software, including R package development, for quality assurance and data processing) into our research. Traditionally, our focus is on vertical one-dimensional process-based modeling of aquatic ecosystems by coupling hydrodynamic with water quality models. These coupled models are powerful tools to explore long-term ecosystem dynamics under various stressors such as climate change or eutrophication, and to quantify the causality between abiotic and biotic events across different time scales. 

Our current focus areas are

## Projects


**Here is an overview of our current projects:**

:crystal_ball: **Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning:** coupling process-based models and/or scientific knowledge (physical/ecological laws and constraints) with innovative deep learning models

:earth_americas: **Landscape Water Quality Analysis:** upscaling and exploring spatiotemporal monitoring data to understand nutrient limitation, primary production, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions 

:busts_in_silhouette: **LakeEnsemblR-Water Quality:** building a software framework to faciliate setting up, running and post-processing an ensemble of aquatic ecosystem models for structural model-intercomparison
