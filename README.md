Welcome! We're the Aquatic Ecosystem Modeling team from the Freshwater Ecology section at Aarhus University, Denmark.

To advance aquatic ecosystem modelling, we integrate **model theory** (developing novel models and improving existing code), **model application** (running models on study sites for scenario analysis), and **data science/software development** (developing scientific software, including R package development, for quality assurance and data processing) into our research. Traditionally, our focus is on vertical one-dimensional process-based modeling of aquatic ecosystems by coupling hydrodynamic with water quality models. These coupled models are powerful tools to explore long-term ecosystem dynamics under various stressors such as climate change or eutrophication, and to quantify the causality between abiotic and biotic events across different time scales.
